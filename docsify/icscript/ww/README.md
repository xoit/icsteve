First sharing about IC script.

So the script is not only about tcl, the repo will cover:

- tcl
- perl
- python
- php
- js
- html
- and more

I have written some content and will reuse some old articles, so even I am busy with something, I can still keep updating the sharing weekly.

I am not a software developer, but I am willing to learn some software technology and design pattern which I want to be used in IC design.

BTW, welcome to recommend the good articles and materials. I will take my effort to understand it and share with you all. Let's get started.

## phpdesktop

Today I am going to recommend this phpdesktop program which is a good tool to build local applications.

In my following sharing, I will talk about php a lot. PHP is a good script to build application and easy to install on the servers.

Basically, phpdesktop is a local application which allows you to run php and web server without pain. We will use a lot of web technology to share the reports, display the chart and maybe organize the flow.

You can download the windows build here to have a try.

- [https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/chrome-v57.0-rc](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/chrome-v57.0-rc)

Think of phpdesktop as Electron for PHP.

The phpdesktop already includes some script samples to let you get started easily.

- blenc_encode.php
- blenc_myscript.php
- cookies.php
- download.php
- env-variables.php
- error-404.php
- error-500.php
- execute-command.php
- forms.php
- google.php
- html5-video.php
- iframe.php
- index.php
- javascript-api.php
- loading-error.php
- mouse-cursor-loading.php
- no-cache.php
- open-folder-in-explorer.php
- php-error.php
- phpinfo.php
- popup.php
- pretty-urls.php
- request-quota.php
- session.php
- speech-recognition.php
- sqlite-database.db
- sqlite.php
- style.css
- temp-dir.php
- upload.php

Welcome to discuss more application about this tool. How you can use it. What I can see is that it is powerful and I can use it for my own automation jobs and more communication with IC work servers.

## Why php

- php is a server based script, not client based script.
- php is friendly to ICer which works with tcl/perl/python.
- php communite is active, and development is still on-going.
- php is easy to build and debug.
- php is also good to build command line interface.

## Next Week

I will share some usage of phpdesktop from my side and another new topic.

- Tcl package management (Refresh the old topic)
