      <description>This year, we went to Shoreline Lake to view the Moutain View the independent day fireworks.
It is the first firework year after COVID. We are so close to the fireworks.
It is not a good experience to having the car park in the parking lot. Very difficult to go in and come out.
Never come near the &amp;ldquo;concert&amp;rdquo; and park the car in the parking lot.
Fireworks in Moutain View At 9:45, the sky was almost dark, and the lights were off.</description>

      <description>Today is my 2nd time volunteer experience at AAH (https://www.animalassistedhappiness.org/).
Other than school volunteer, I have less experience on other organizations. AAH is providing the oportunities with the animals. I like close to the animals.

Pick and clean up the horse manure Pile the leaves under the tree Fill the water Check and fill the big holes Pick and dump the branches This time, we have 5 people total.</description>
