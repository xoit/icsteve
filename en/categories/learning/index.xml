      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Project Management&amp;rdquo; Course, one of the topics is &amp;ldquo;Communication Plan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phrase &amp;ldquo;communication plan&amp;rdquo; is used, I feel it is pretty clear what should I do to sell the product and have better connection with the users, and among the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication plans can help you clarify the purpose of a product launch or new initiative and officially determine the messages you want to deliver to your intended audience(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently, I enrolled the Project Management course in Coursera. The course is delivered by Google.
I found this is interesting, because usually we have some basic knowledge how to manage a small team, and how to manage a simple project.
For example, plan a trip, upgrade the gararge, etc.
After going through the first course, I found this course can really help to correct my mindset and change the way how to communicate with other people.</description>
