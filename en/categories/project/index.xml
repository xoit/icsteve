      <description>Web technology will become our daily work technology, especially for developers and engineers.
We can use web to do a lot of things, that does not mean we can not use local client GUI program.
But web application gives us a lot of pros to makes itself a new trend.
I will use my work area (Integrated Circuit Design Industry) as the example, and record the process of &amp;ldquo;CDX-DASH&amp;rdquo;.
How to Start First, before we start, we should pick a area you want to develop or dive into.</description>

      <description>This year, we went to Shoreline Lake to view the Moutain View the independent day fireworks.
It is the first firework year after COVID. We are so close to the fireworks.
It is not a good experience to having the car park in the parking lot. Very difficult to go in and come out.
Never come near the &amp;ldquo;concert&amp;rdquo; and park the car in the parking lot.
Fireworks in Moutain View At 9:45, the sky was almost dark, and the lights were off.</description>

      <description>Today is my 2nd time volunteer experience at AAH (https://www.animalassistedhappiness.org/).
Other than school volunteer, I have less experience on other organizations. AAH is providing the oportunities with the animals. I like close to the animals.
Clean the Horse House We already know the process:
Pick and clean up the horse manure Pile the leaves under the tree Fill the water Check and fill the big holes Pick and dump the branches This time, we have 5 people total.</description>

      <title>3 Good Practices of Hardward CAD Framework</title>
      <link>https://icsteve.com/en/2022/01/my_sight_of_good_cad_framework/</link>

      <guid>https://icsteve.com/en/2022/01/my_sight_of_good_cad_framework/</guid>
      <description>In IC (Integrated Circuit) industry, CAD is a function to make hardware designer&amp;rsquo;s life easy. This is how I define CAD in hardware design. &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo; contains different meanings.
Easy to understand the inputs Easy to use the functions Easy to check the result (Accurate and reliable) A lot of people always like to use Apple products as an example. Here I am.
Apple has suitable technologies but not the most advanced technology.</description>

      <title>What is &#34;Communication Plan&#34;</title>
      <link>https://icsteve.com/en/2022/01/communication_plan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Project Management&amp;rdquo; Course, one of the topics is &amp;ldquo;Communication Plan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phrase &amp;ldquo;communication plan&amp;rdquo; is used, I feel it is pretty clear what should I do to sell the product and have better connection with the users, and among the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication plans can help you clarify the purpose of a product launch or new initiative and officially determine the messages you want to deliver to your intended audience(s).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Goals (tcl-csh-cli)</title>

      <description>As a project manager, one very important task is to learn, understand, broadcast the project goal correctly and efficiently. This must be documented and put a place, so that project manager can go through it in the meeting and the team can refer to the document any time.
The solution could be dropbox, sharepoint, onenote, git, ftp, etc.
Goal of &amp;ldquo;tcl-csh-cli&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the goal of &amp;ldquo;tcl-csh-cli&amp;rdquo; project.
Major Goal Create a framework using tcl and csh to handle the complex design requirement.</description>

      <description>This is a project used to demostrate the project management process and also it is my first project which could benefit the IC design community.
I will build a course to finish this project through several months. And the project name is &amp;ldquo;Build Cli with tcl and csh&amp;rdquo;.
The project will be split to several sections in a course to tell some key technology stuff and program management skills.
Project Initialzation First question, how does this project come out?</description>

      <title>Project technology selection (tcl-csh-cli)</title>
      <link>https://icsteve.com/en/2021/11/tcl_csh_cli_3/</link>

      <guid>https://icsteve.com/en/2021/11/tcl_csh_cli_3/</guid>
      <description>In this post, I would like to talk about my view on technology selection.
When we talk about VLSI CAD (not EDA), most people will think about CS background, coding ability, etc.
But I want to think out of box, as a project manager, I can not just pick option 1 or option 2. It is always good to use SME (Subject Matter Expert) tool. So we may need to group a team with option 1 and option 2 mixture.</description>

      <title>Project Management Notes</title>

      <description>Recently, I enrolled the Project Management course in Coursera. The course is delivered by Google.
I found this is interesting, because usually we have some basic knowledge how to manage a small team, and how to manage a simple project.
For example, plan a trip, upgrade the gararge, etc.
After going through the first course, I found this course can really help to correct my mindset and change the way how to communicate with other people.</description>

      <title>Use tree command to list the structure</title>
      <link>https://icsteve.com/en/2021/01/tree_command/</link>

      <description>tree command is helping to show the structure of folders and files.
Real Case When discussing the folder structure via video meeting, express the structure is a little bit challenge if we have a lot of levels and files. How to make the folder and file structure clear when we present something?
. means in current dir. and we can use pwd to replace it.
➜ tree -a --dirsfirst . ├── test -&amp;gt; test_3 ├── test_1 │ └── file_1 ├── test_2 │ └── file_2 ├── test_3 │ └── file_3 └── .</description>

      <description>This is a website to help on the English pronunciation.
Youglish : https://youglish.com
The website will pick a lot of youtube videos which includes the words we searched. You will see it shows up 1951 videos and now is currently playing the 4th one.
This is quite useful because not like the dictionary, the video will not only tell you how the word is pronounced, but also tell you when it is used via video, not just a sentence.</description>

      <title>Csh Argument</title>

      <guid>https://icsteve.com/en/2020/12/csh_argument/</guid>
      <description>Case Study There is a cshell script file which is working in others&amp;rsquo; environment but not in yours, one of prossibilities is that the cshell will load the unit cshell file ~/.cshrc( cshrc). So there might be some setting in others&amp;rsquo; .cshrc files, but not in yours.
Understand In Unix-like system, when you want to get the help of one program from Command Line Interface (CLI), we can try the following ways, like csh.</description>
