      <description>I have tried many different tools to organize the information collected online. The services like raindrop.io, App List, cubox, etc. They all have their own use cases and scenarios. And Cubox can support tags, date, sort, and other more functions. Comparing to these apps, Notion is a good replacement which can serve the collection very well.
Result This is the view for my current inbox (Table View). The links are added to the inbox by sharing function from my iPhone when I browse the technical articles or news.</description>
