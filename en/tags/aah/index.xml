      <description>Today is my 2nd time volunteer experience at AAH (https://www.animalassistedhappiness.org/).
Other than school volunteer, I have less experience on other organizations. AAH is providing the oportunities with the animals. I like close to the animals.

Pick and clean up the horse manure Pile the leaves under the tree Fill the water Check and fill the big holes Pick and dump the branches This time, we have 5 people total.</description>
