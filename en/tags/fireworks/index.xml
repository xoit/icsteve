      <description>This year, we went to Shoreline Lake to view the Moutain View the independent day fireworks.
It is the first firework year after COVID. We are so close to the fireworks.
It is not a good experience to having the car park in the parking lot. Very difficult to go in and come out.
Never come near the &amp;ldquo;concert&amp;rdquo; and park the car in the parking lot.
Fireworks in Moutain View At 9:45, the sky was almost dark, and the lights were off.</description>
