      <description>In IC (Integrated Circuit) industry, CAD is a function to make hardware designer&amp;rsquo;s life easy. This is how I define CAD in hardware design. &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo; contains different meanings.
Easy to understand the inputs Easy to use the functions Easy to check the result (Accurate and reliable) A lot of people always like to use Apple products as an example. Here I am.
Apple has suitable technologies but not the most advanced technology.</description>

      <title>What is &#34;Communication Plan&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Project Management&amp;rdquo; Course, one of the topics is &amp;ldquo;Communication Plan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phrase &amp;ldquo;communication plan&amp;rdquo; is used, I feel it is pretty clear what should I do to sell the product and have better connection with the users, and among the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication plans can help you clarify the purpose of a product launch or new initiative and officially determine the messages you want to deliver to your intended audience(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Project Goals (tcl-csh-cli)</title>

      <description>As a project manager, one very important task is to learn, understand, broadcast the project goal correctly and efficiently. This must be documented and put a place, so that project manager can go through it in the meeting and the team can refer to the document any time.
The solution could be dropbox, sharepoint, onenote, git, ftp, etc.
Goal of &amp;ldquo;tcl-csh-cli&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the goal of &amp;ldquo;tcl-csh-cli&amp;rdquo; project.
Major Goal Create a framework using tcl and csh to handle the complex design requirement.</description>

      <title>Project Kick-off (tcl-csh-cli)</title>

      <description>This is a project used to demostrate the project management process and also it is my first project which could benefit the IC design community.
I will build a course to finish this project through several months. And the project name is &amp;ldquo;Build Cli with tcl and csh&amp;rdquo;.
The project will be split to several sections in a course to tell some key technology stuff and program management skills.
Project Initialzation First question, how does this project come out?</description>

      <title>Project technology selection (tcl-csh-cli)</title>

      <description>In this post, I would like to talk about my view on technology selection.
When we talk about VLSI CAD (not EDA), most people will think about CS background, coding ability, etc.
But I want to think out of box, as a project manager, I can not just pick option 1 or option 2. It is always good to use SME (Subject Matter Expert) tool. So we may need to group a team with option 1 and option 2 mixture.</description>

      <title>Project Management Notes</title>

      <description>Recently, I enrolled the Project Management course in Coursera. The course is delivered by Google.
I found this is interesting, because usually we have some basic knowledge how to manage a small team, and how to manage a simple project.
For example, plan a trip, upgrade the gararge, etc.
After going through the first course, I found this course can really help to correct my mindset and change the way how to communicate with other people.</description>
