I will show some flags' usage which I am using a lot. The options are very similar to the ls command.\n-a, list all the files including the hidden files. In the CAD development, some files are for debugging purpose or for one-time configuration, and they are hidden. To list the hidden files, -a must be present.\n-d, only list the folder, In some cases, the file list is huge but we only care about the folder structure. The folder will tell the clear structure\n-L, controls the levels, sometimes, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to dive into all the folder levels and I only want to show 2 levels, then use -L 2.\n-t, sort by last modified time. The flag is useful because when we want to see some new files generated recently, we can easily find them at the end of the tree view.\nAnother useful function is HTML or JSON output. In these days, HTML document is very popular and we can use tree to output the html code or json file to use them in our web applications.\nImprovement or Exercises Please try below commands and see the output.\nmkdir tree_demo cd tree_demo mkdir -p demo_1 demo_2 demo_3 demo_4 demo_5 touch demo_1/file_1 demo_2/file_2_1 demo_2/file_2_2 demo_3/file_3 demo_5/file_5 touch .demo_6 tree `pwd` tree `pwd` -a tree `pwd` -a --dirsfirst touch demo_2/file_2_2 tree `pwd` -a -t --dirsfirst tree `pwd` -a -t -L 1 --dirsfirst tree `pwd` -a -t -d -L 1 --dirsfirst  ","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"tree command is helping to show the structure of folders and files.\nReal Case When discussing the folder structure via video meeting, express the structure is a little bit challenge if we have a lot of levels and files.

The services like raindrop.io, App List, cubox, etc. They all have their own use cases and scenarios. And Cubox can support tags, date, sort, and other more functions. Comparing to these apps, Notion is a good replacement which can serve the collection very well.\nResult This is the view for my current inbox (Table View). The links are added to the inbox by sharing function from my iPhone when I browse the technical articles or news. And they are also from my EDGE browser on MAC or PC. When I browse online for news or technical topic, or work related items, I will simply click share the link and put them to the Notion/Inbox.\nThe table in Notion is a type of database, so we can add any column we want. I added one checkbox column called \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; (Check Notion and Obsidian), tags and create date. At the bottom, for each column, we can also define the summary for each column.\nSwitch to Gallery View\nUnderstand Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to build the Inbox page in your Notion. In the Inbox or Collection, you can put anything you want, an article link, an apple store app link, a piece of idea, a text message, and so on. This is easy to be done by just click the share button on the smart phone. Since we are building a read later database, so we can put any property we want to each item. I have uninstalled several apps in my iPhone, what about you?\nCreate a new page Click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button next to the WORKSPACE or PRIVATE. And then give the new page a name, for instance, \u0026ldquo;Inbox\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Collection\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd \u0026ldquo;Table\u0026rdquo; database Create a table for the new page\nThen you will get an empty page like this.\nCustomize Columns Now, we can define the columns in our collection table. I want to add 2 more columns, one is \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; and another one is \u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; is a checkbox to tell which would be going to the Obsidian, transfer the knowing to knowledge.\n\u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo; is the date and time when each row is created. This will tell me when did I snap the article in.\nImprove Now we have the table, by install the iOS or Android Notion app, click any share button and save the content to the Notion\u0026gt;Collection. All the Notion with the same account will update the table, and then start to do the close reading, transfer the knowledge, etc.\nThe table column also has sort and filter function. Please play around the followings:\n Add a \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo; column. Once the article is read, mark it. Filter the column \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, only display \u0026ldquo;Unread\u0026rdquo; items.
