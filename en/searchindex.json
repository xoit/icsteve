This is how I define CAD in hardware design. \u0026ldquo;Easy\u0026rdquo; contains different meanings.\nEasy to understand the inputs Easy to use the functions Easy to check the result (Accurate and reliable) A lot of people always like to use Apple products as an example. Here I am.\nApple has suitable technologies but not the most advanced technology.\nThe most advanced technology means more risk. But to put the superior technology which is best fit the customer is the key to success.\nBUT, the best solution is always the one that fits the scenario best no matter it follows the following principles or not.\nCAD Framework is designed for the professional All the hardware designers are experts in the industry. When I first joined the CAD group, I was thinking about how to help and what can I help the professionals.\nI need to find out my value to the CAD utility users, to our professional hardware designers since I am not better than them in terms of making chips.\nSince the customers of VLSI CAD utilities are professional hardware engineers, the goal of CAD utilities is to develop a set of tools that can help with accuracy, productivity.\nEasy to get the data Easy to send the data Easy to use the data In a big organization, easy also means standardization.\nGood practice 1: Least Astonishment a.k.a. least surprise\nConfiguration is always a good example to explain this rule.\nIn CAD utility, we may have multiple ways to configure the operations.\nSome of them are from environmental variables Some of them are from the configuration file, like (yaml, json) Some of them are from project hook, defaults, etc. Some of them are from handover criteria Some of them are from the EDA tool itself Sometimes we can not avoid introducing confusion. Then the problem becomes how to resolve the issue, clear the confusion.\nSingle Source of True (SSoT) And in our configuration file, we may have an if-else statement to switch based on the conditions.\nIf the learning curve is so steep, it is not suitable for new projects. They will refuse to migrate.\nEven the engineers master the utility once, they will learn again in the next project.\nThe ideal case is that, in our platform, all the utilities can read the configuration from one source.\nBut this is not practical. The hardware design is not AI-ready yet. We still need to handle a lot of cases during daily engineering work.\nSo the solution is that we can split the function or modularize the function layer by layer. Each layer, we have the APIs, or we call configuration files, for inputs and outputs.\nThe inputs and outputs are well defined in one entry file. The file is called \u0026ldquo;Metadata\u0026rdquo;, and the APIs should consistently deliver with \u0026ldquo;Metadata\u0026rdquo;, no guessing.\n{ \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot; : { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;flow_config\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;user\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;icsteve\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;$rel\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;connect\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;connect_api_1\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;dataset\u0026quot; : { \u0026quot;width\u0026quot; : 100, \u0026quot;height\u0026quot; : 100 } } In the real scenario, we can have more constraints. Like, the dataset must be the objects, k-v pairs.\nInstead of understanding this rule as a single file, we bring the metadata concept, which represents the \u0026ldquo;Single Source\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd in metadata, we also need to describe the relationship between each metadata key. This could be part of the metadata as well.\nThe relationship ($rel) is the logic for certain business needs, so it requires product SPEC to describe how to use and explain the relations.\nUnambiguous The \u0026ldquo;unambiguous\u0026rdquo; is always talked about when writing a requirement/schema or configuration.\nSome configuration is good to use on|off or 1|0, then we should keep it simple.\nSometimes 1 or 0 is no telling what is going to do, so we might need to use the word precisely.\nWhen defining schema or design configuration, it is better to send it out to different people for review. If any questions come into your email box, that means the setting is not clear enough what will happen.\nConventions vs Configuration I prefer explicit configuration, not conventions.\nBut the conventions (default naming) can make the configuration pretty simple.\nGood practice 2: Guide instead of Blaming When users are asking usage questions, or they abuse some options.\nDid you just reply: \u0026ldquo;Please read the document!!!\u0026rdquo;\nNo! No!! No!!!\nMost users are experienced users using the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.\nIf the user is not clear, that means The philosophy of current utility design is terrible!\nI always suggest the new CAD comers participate in several project tapeout. Then we can get the real scenario our customers are facing.\nOf course, Software and hardware share the same ground. But still, there are some DDD (domain-driven design) differences.\nExamples and Templates Provide enough templates and examples to bring the users in as quickly as possible.\nThe template is essential. Users are able to start with the templates (recipes), which are tested by the CAD developers.\nTo educate the user, what should we do?\nHowTo Develop a training material to help users to build knowledge.\nWhatNext When an error happened, try to give out:\nWhat happened, error message, error code, etc. Error code location, highlight if possible Give out the suggestion, whatnext Dryrun We have thousands of configuration items, it is not easy to remember all of them.\nSo to review the settings which will apply to the upcoming run is essential, helping the users to check and identify the potential issues.\nThis is called the ability of \u0026ldquo;dry-run\u0026rdquo;.\nDry-run log is another art of work that could be very useful.\nHelp System The help system is not only about documents and training.\nThe document could be in code (show during logging and runtime)\nYou could have a 100-page word/pdf document, but think about how do the users use the document.\nThe help system also includes -h / --help, man page, error handling, variable tracing, etc.\nThe help system is a big topic. We will talk about it next week Help System.\nGood practice 3: Keep it Simple, Stupid Decouple, more is less We have some cases that we need to re-use some utility or code, and then modularization is a good approach.\nThink about this case, the library is used everywhere, and one day there is a bug introduced which causes the whole system down.\nOf course, we have other ways to roll back. And reusability is really required in our scenario.\nWhat if I control the revision, and for each module, it is checked out separately. Then even I want to update the common utility for a specific application, it will not affect others.\nFunctional Options The argument or option should not be hard to understand and should not be too many.\nIf there are many arguments needed, the utility may need to consider use input configuration files as well.\nVisualization CLI is needed for the first place, but GUI or Visualization is also great to have.\nThat means web technology is a good skill to gain in the CAD career.\n","id":6,"section":"posts","summary":"In IC (Integrated Circuit) industry, CAD is a function to make hardware designer\u0026rsquo;s life easy.

I never think about I can group them and call all these activities \u0026ldquo;Communication Plan\u0026rdquo;.\nPrepare the \u0026ldquo;Communication Plan\u0026rdquo; When preparing the plan, always ask ourselves these questions.\nWhy do you want to communicate with the community? (What’s your purpose?) To whom do you want to communicate it? (Who’s your audience?) What do you want to communicate? (What’s your message?) How do you want to communicate it? (What communication channels will you use?) Whom should you contact, and what should you do to use those channels? (How will you distribute your message?) Once these questions get answered, we have a better picture for the CAD product communication.\nFirst, during the project implementation, project manager needs to communicate with the developers to make sure the project is on track. Like check the milestone, enable the collabration, resolve the issues, etc.\nSecond, after involving the key users, collect the feedback, understand the usage difficulty of new CAD product.\nThird, think about the documentation, not only for the end-users, but also for the development community.\nLast but not the least, talk to upper management for the upcomming new product or followup revision of current product.\nConvert \u0026ldquo;Communication Plan\u0026rdquo; to a document and share Like all other plans in the project, \u0026ldquo;Communication Plan\u0026rdquo; needs to be clearly documented, and transparent to the project members and users.\nHere is a table for us to easily go through the key items one by one and then put into the document.\nDescription Frequency Channel Audience Owner Status Kick off meeting One time Zoom + Meeting-Room All internal stakeholders and project team members Project Manager@PM Planned Status updates Weekly Zoom + Meeting-Room All project team members Project Manager@PM Planned Milestone and deliverable updates Monthly Zoom All project team members, stakeholders optional Project Manager@PM Planned Project stand-up (check-in) Daily Slack Project team Project Team Planned Weekly User Synch-up Weekly Zoom + Meeting-Room Customers and project team Customers and Project Team Planned Use QR code to generate calendar Here is one of the online utility to generate the QR code image which can help to be added into the mobile calendar.\nQRickit for calendar generation\nUse iphone to scan the code:\nUse python to generate ics files The goal for the python script is to generate different kinds of meeting place holders for a project.\nKick off meeting Weekly meeting to track the project status Milestone Review meetings Meetings to resolve the conflicts and issues Project closing meeting To test the following function\n# Install iCalendar pip install icalendar # Run the function python create_ics.py # Test example.ics # Double click example.ics #!env python3 from icalendar import Calendar, Event, vCalAddress, vText import pytz from datetime import datetime import os from pathlib import Path # Creating icalendar/event event = Event() event.add('summary', 'Python meeting about calendaring') event.add('dtstart', datetime(2021, 1, 12, 8, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)) event.add('dtend', datetime(2021, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)) event.add('dtstamp', datetime(2021, 1, 12, 0, 10, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)) # Adding Organizer organizer = vCalAddress('MAILTO:organizer@example.com') organizer.params['cn'] = vText('Organizer') organizer.params['role'] = vText('CHAIR') event['organizer'] = organizer # Adding attendee attendee = vCalAddress('MAILTO:foobar@example.com') attendee.params['cn'] = vText('Foo Bar') attendee.params['ROLE'] = vText('REQ-PARTICIPANT') event.add('attendee', attendee, encode=0) # Adding location event['location'] = vText('Zoom Link') # Adding events to calendar cal = Calendar() cal.add_component(event) directory = str(Path(__file__).parent.parent) + \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; # print(directory) f = open(os.path.join(directory, 'example.ics'), 'wb') f.write(cal.to_ical()) f.close() # vim: ft=python ","id":8,"section":"posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the \u0026ldquo;Project Management\u0026rdquo; Course, one of the topics is \u0026ldquo;Communication Plan\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the phrase \u0026ldquo;communication plan\u0026rdquo; is used, I feel it is pretty clear what should I do to sell the product and have better connection with the users, and among the developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommunication plans can help you clarify the purpose of a product launch or new initiative and officially determine the messages you want to deliver to your intended audience(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e","tags":["PM","Learning"],"title":"What is \"Communication Plan\"","uri":"https://icsteve.com/en/2022/01/communication_plan/","year":"2022"},{"content":"As a project manager, one very important task is to learn, understand, broadcast the project goal correctly and efficiently.

Maybe not, this is more like a demostrate project, we can keep maintaining it if we find a good path. And usually, there are a lot of commercial solutions.

Yes, we need, but must be built on top of CLI and the priority is low. What is the cost and profit? Time is the main costs for this project, and profit is to make friends, and earn money for support and plugin sale. Define deliveries: A framework for developers to develop the flows.

The course is delivered by Google.\nI found this is interesting, because usually we have some basic knowledge how to manage a small team, and how to manage a simple project.\nFor example, plan a trip, upgrade the gararge, etc.\nAfter going through the first course, I found this course can really help to correct my mindset and change the way how to communicate with other people.\nIs project management necessary? Till last year, I am in charge of the release, I realize that project management is really important. A project really needs a good plan and also after the major work is done, doing some follow-ups, etc.\nWe have a release happening every several months. First several releases is OK since we have less customers, and did not get a lot of support.

Vim could search match multiple patterns, use `\\` to escape `|`. ``` :norm /Pattern1\\|Pattern2 ``` 4. Python is mostly used for front-end design, recently I have time to start paying attention to python + VLSI, I wonder if anyone is using this? - [MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/) 5. \u0026quot;direnv\u0026quot; is a tool that can switch work env. It is very convenient to use. Many programming languages have their own env management tool, for instance, python has conda. - [direnv - unclutter your .profile | direnv](https://direnv.net/) - [conda - conda 4.9.2.post24 e37cf84a documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) 6. There are many commercial tools available to assist you in designing constraints, checking constraints, comparing constraints, and products that I will not list. As CAD engineer, you can go play around with \u0026quot;sdcparser\u0026quot;. 7. IP management: Very often, if you are a front-end and back-end module designer, when you start working, the std library, ip library, etc. are already ready, and all the required views are ready to use. one of CAD's jobs is to manage these IPs and generate the entire One of the jobs of CAD is to manage these IPs and generate the views needed for the entire ASIC process, and to make sure that the IPs are legal at the time of tapeout. When you run EDA job, the screen is scrolling fast, maybe you already know that you can use \u0026quot;Ctrl+s\u0026quot; to freeze a terminal window, and \u0026quot;Ctrl+q\u0026quot; when you need to resume. 9. which \u0026quot;naming style\u0026quot; do you usually use more? - Camel Case (ex: aprVar, aprProc, aprPackage). - Pascal Case (ex: AprVar, AprProc, AprPackage). - Underscores (ex: apr_var, apr_proc, apr_package). 10. Normally, if you want to search the stdout log of Terminal on the screen, you should use tee and look at the log file of eda directly. tmux can search directly, enter copy-mode, press ctrl-b first and then [ , if it is vi key binding, you can use `/` or `?` If it is a vi key binding, you can use / or ? 11. If you like to use Markdown to write technical documents, try \u0026quot;docsify\u0026quot;. - [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) 12. Long time ago when browsing Reddit, I found this, this is actually very useful, can be used as a CAD learning practice. - [EDAV | Online EDA Viewer](https://edaviewer.com/) 13. Sometimes there is a window unresponsive on Unix X desktop, ps or top may have too many other similar programs, such as many terminals, then you can run \u0026quot;xkill\u0026quot; and use the mouse to click the unresponsive window. 14. As a CAD, development company, team process, development of some Utilities, Program, Platform, version management is very important, many companies use git, maintained by the company IT, or commercial tools to pay for technical support. As a CAD, you must have a strong sense of versioning, maintain your own check-in, use git to manage your process scripts, try \u0026quot;gogs\u0026quot;, which is what I used for myself at the beginning, to practice how to manage a large code versioning, resolve dependencies, and write scripts to assist in releasing, etc. - [Gogs: A painless self-hosted Git service](https://gogs.io/) 15. sometimes you want to combine several commands, there are several ways to do this. tcl is a good glue language, or other scripting languages, both of which are also convenient without compiling, and another option is to just use the csh alias command, other shells like that. Here comes the point, you can use \u0026quot;! *\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;! :\u0026lt;num\u0026gt;\u0026quot; to access command parameters. ``` alias mycmd \u0026quot;echo \\! * ;\\\\\\ echo this is a long command \\! :1 ; \\\\\\ echo this is a very long command \\! :2 ;\u0026quot; ``` 16. If you are not so familiar with databases, and struggle to get started, in writing script and want to use databases, or datasets: to solve the problem of the beginning of everything, use \u0026quot;csv\u0026quot; and slowly learn more about it, this is also a more than good just, is a very good dataset format, in In some cases and is preferred. 17. 17. Many times we use the \u0026quot;tee\u0026quot; command to write screen logs, multiple commands are not to use multiple tee and then cat together? No, tee also has append function, use \u0026quot;tee -a\u0026quot;. 18. 18. Many times you have to use pipe + tee to write cshell scripts, it is very convenient to use \u0026quot;. /foo | tee foo.log\u0026quot;, this only write out stdout, not srderr, need to debug when the error message in the foo.log is not, should be written as such ``` . /foo 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | tee foo.log Or . /foo |\u0026amp; tee foo.log ``` ## CAD | Opinions ### 1. IC or CS The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you want to do. If you are interested in IC, IC still have to do, as long as the industry does not disappear, there is still a demand for manpower; Speaking of CS is not more promising, my personal view is yes, the largest industry in the information age may be the software industry, but note that any industry positions have a bottom and top, CS so, IC is no exception. ### 2. Another reason to learn Tcl A motivation to learn tcl: Many scripting languages support tk GUI programming, so by learning tcl/tk, you learn a GUI language, plus tcl is almost the most important Interface language for IC. ### 3. Copyright awareness I see a lot of good sharing, but every time I see something, my first question is really, can this be used to spread? As my own notes may not be a problem, I gave up some expertise on the entry point to share, and instead share general knowledge, I see many articles to share is no problem, but need to pay attention to: how you protect the intellectual property rights of others today, tomorrow others will also respect your intellectual property rights. ### 4. CAD skill tree - PDK CAD skill tree: master the structure of the PDK and the role of each file, and be familiar with how to use each file. As a CAD engineer, you are often dealing with data, one of which is the PDK provided by foundry, called Process Design Kit, which is a modeling of a specific semiconductor manufacturing process, using the model provided in the PDK, together with the purchased EDA, you can design the chip, including but not limited to: technology file, design rule, spice... CAD skill tree: master the structure of PDK and the role of each file, and be familiar with how to use each file. ### 5. Timing Uncertainty (1 \u0026amp; 2) Q: What is the purpose of setting timing uncertainty in chip design constraints? How do I set it? Answer: When I first came into contact with constraints, I was doing Logical Synthesis and STA, at that time it was still 65nm, the constraints were not that complicated, and the experience value was good. After more and more exposure, from STA, APR to CAD, my thoughts are changing. As an overview, uncertainty setting, as the name suggests, is used to cover the entire process of uncertainty, different stages need to consider different uncertainty, generally for the downstream work to reserve the timing space. We are going to give examples from back to front, first STA timing signoff settings from the foundry process uncertainty, generally process manufacturers for the process line to do debugging, such as ocv. also include different products back to some of the experience of the actual test, the product on the yield, DFT test, work environment, aging and a series of product itself The product's own considerations. Of course, STA has many other factors that may affect the uncertainty setting, such as the accuracy of STA, PBA vs GBA, the margin reserved for SI or transition, etc. The next step is Routing, the more the previous step requires a certainty that includes the value of the subsequent steps plus some of the issues that need to be considered in this step, the routing uncertainty mainly covers the gap between global routing and real routing. EDA tools are constantly improving the accuracy of virtual routing and narrowing the gap between it and real routing. Specifically on more (not considering detour or congestion and other issues triggered by the large delay), to give an example of a little off, due to routing after the impact on the path delay more virtual will have longer or shorter, plus ocv, this value in several iteration can be estimated out, one of the empirical values. To be continued ### 6. The scoping ability on the development Recently, I found that some CAD engineers are not open to the understanding of resources, most of the time human resources are far more than hardware resources, in addition to finding the right people, before at least to their own work related to the upstream and downstream dependency to reach the level of use, I see many people only stay in the level of know (know), the reason behind is to use you to better The reason behind this is that once you use it, you can ask questions and communicate better. From the CAD work, I think in familiar (familiar) and master (master) before there is a skill to go deeper guide (guidance), here the guidance is not to go to the fingertips, but you know what he should be like, a kind of control of the expected, more in-depth, if there is a mistake, you can know what causes it. ### 7. My opinion of the very basics of IC I asked an interactive question earlier, what do you think is the most important basic skill for IC, whether front-end, back-end, or CAD? My answer is Timing, because in my opinion, it is the most basic thing to achieve the function, and it is also a hurdle for hardware to differentiate software development, there is a lot of knowledge around timing. I use an analogy, to achieve the IC knowledge of food and clothing, Timing to understand, and then well-off can look at Power or something, wealthy to another methodology, High Performance, Low Power, etc.. ### 8.

CAD and overtime Overtime\u0026rsquo;s exist in any industry, construction workers build hospitals in a few days, software Release phase overtime, hardware Tapeout final to sprint. If things could be parallel, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t there be no need for overtime? Not really. When things are parallel, the cost of resources consumed for the same goal is increased, and under certain conditions (overtime), the cost is lowest. The goal of ICCAD is to increase efficiency, and in some cases with the help of CAD, touch the fish and reduce the intensity of your own work. ICCAD also has the advantage that CAD can dabble in more areas, strengthening its moat and enhancing its indispensability.\n2. Using APIs is a basic CAD skill No matter what framework or system is becoming more and more closed, and with open source systems like Android, users get a hundred flowers, each with good and bad effects. So what can CAD cope with? The data interface will become more and more open, and the ability to access data is a basic skill of CAD.\n3. What ICSteve will share There are many ways to share and export the summary knowledge of CAD and IC alone. After years of working with CAD, I have found that there are several types of capabilities that can significantly improve a designer\u0026rsquo;s productivity and experience.\nContinuous optimization of the development environment Modularization of basic knowledge, instantiation, data, and tools\nKnowledge is a treasure but practice is the key\n4. CAD and Software Development If you want to take CAD further, my suggestion is to do both upward and downward management, going upward through the architecture and participating in CAD decisions at the management level, and going downward to understand the organization and bottlenecks of hardware projects and provide solutions.\n5. Chip design in the cloud The key is the word \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo;, either save time, shorten Time to Market, or save cost, reduce the cost increase brought by peak usage. After the cloud, the right to use the data, whether your design will become a sample to be learned and other issues need to be considered. On the cloud may be some positions will be reduced, there are also some positions will be added, such as cloud data interaction (learn some container technology, network technology always overflow).\n","id":16,"section":"posts","summary":"Welcome to follow ICSteve Knowledge Planet (https://t.zsxq.com/eqr72RB).

Comparing to these apps, Notion is a good replacement which can serve the collection very well.\nResult This is the view for my current inbox (Table View). The links are added to the inbox by sharing function from my iPhone when I browse the technical articles or news. And they are also from my EDGE browser on MAC or PC. When I browse online for news or technical topic, or work related items, I will simply click share the link and put them to the Notion/Inbox.\nThe table in Notion is a type of database, so we can add any column we want. I added one checkbox column called \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; (Check Notion and Obsidian), tags and create date. At the bottom, for each column, we can also define the summary for each column.\nSwitch to Gallery View\nUnderstand Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to build the Inbox page in your Notion. In the Inbox or Collection, you can put anything you want, an article link, an apple store app link, a piece of idea, a text message, and so on. This is easy to be done by just click the share button on the smart phone. Since we are building a read later database, so we can put any property we want to each item. I have uninstalled several apps in my iPhone, what about you?\nCreate a new page Click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button next to the WORKSPACE or PRIVATE. And then give the new page a name, for instance, \u0026ldquo;Inbox\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Collection\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd \u0026ldquo;Table\u0026rdquo; database Create a table for the new page\nThen you will get an empty page like this.\nCustomize Columns Now, we can define the columns in our collection table. I want to add 2 more columns, one is \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; and another one is \u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; is a checkbox to tell which would be going to the Obsidian, transfer the knowing to knowledge.\n\u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo; is the date and time when each row is created. This will tell me when did I snap the article in.\nImprove Now we have the table, by install the iOS or Android Notion app, click any share button and save the content to the Notion\u0026gt;Collection. All the Notion with the same account will update the table, and then start to do the close reading, transfer the knowledge, etc.\nThe table column also has sort and filter function. Please play around the followings:\nAdd a \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo; column. Once the article is read, mark it. Filter the column \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, only display \u0026ldquo;Unread\u0026rdquo; items. Sort by \u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo; Try the summary of columns, show the count, date duration, etc. Add new property for the data item per the need and it will apply to all the items.

RPC or Remote Procedure Call, which builds on some form of inter-process communication, provides a mechanism for calling a procedure in a program running on a remote system is called. Approaches There are several ways to achieve the goal. Share the data from one process to another process. This is very common, as you may know, digital ASIC design flow is splitted to several stages, floorplan, placement, cts, postcts, route, postroute, physical verification (drc/lvs) etc. Between each stage, we need to hand over the work from one to another.\nApproach Description fork Programs create new process singal file message socket pipe memory fork A new process (external program, thread or just coroutine) could run from current running job. Either the function is done by another executable program or another programming language. Another case is that we may want to distribute the job to different hosts, and make full use of multiple threads.\nsignal file message socket pipe memory Metrics So for hardware design CAD framework, how could we choose? I just share the priority in my mind. You may have your priority in your organization. You may not need to find the most advanced technology, you should only need to figure out the best-fit solutions. This is the engineering mindset :)\nMetric Priority Explanation customer high It is based on the knowledge of pruduct customers stability high Re-try or bad data is critical. adoption high It should be supported by different EDA tools, different program languages. portability medium Very good to have. dependency medium Make the dependency as \u0026ldquo;easy \u0026ldquo;as possible deployment medium It must be easy to deploy. spead low Real time and highly concurrent is not critical. So based on the table above, I vote the first 3 high priority. In the hardware design scenario, CAD framework is serving, helping a specific domain engnieers, they are good at hardware design, and hardware design has various background knowledge requirement. Some ASIC frontend engineers may like python, perl, and makefile, but some ASIC backend engineers may prefer tcl, perl, shell, or EDA tool specific language. Backend process relies on tool a lot nowadays.\nStability is anohter very important one, the cost of re-run is very high. For software, web service, maybe re-send a request will not affect any user experience and only takes one seconds to re-do something. But, in ASIC Backend flow, after routing is done, if you want to fix the floorplan issue, we may already waste a lot of engineering time, license spense, and pay the business loss of losing market time.\nadoption is similar to stability, for ASIC flows, we rely on EDA tools a lot. If the tool can not support the methodology, technology we choose, then communicating with EDA tools will become very bad.\nfor others, they may good to have or just needed in some scenarios.\n","id":27,"section":"posts","summary":"author: \u0026ldquo;Steve\u0026rdquo; title: \u0026ldquo;What is best for IPC or RPC?
