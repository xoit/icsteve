So there might be some setting in others' .cshrc files, but not in yours.\nUnderstand In Unix-like system, when you want to get the help of one program from Command Line Interface (CLI), we can try the following ways, like csh.\n man csh csh \u0026ndash;help  âžœ ~ csh --help tcsh 6.18.01 (Astron) 2012-02-14 (x86_64-apple-darwin) options wide,nls,dl,bye,al,kan,sm,rh,color,filec -b file\tbatch mode, read and execute commands from `file' -c command\trun `command' from next argument -d\tload directory stack from `~/.cshdirs' -Dname[=value]\tdefine environment variable `name' to `value' (DomainOS only) -e\texit on any error -f\tstart faster by ignoring the start-up file -F\tuse fork() instead of vfork() when spawning (ConvexOS only) -i\tinteractive, even when input is not from a terminal -l\tact as a login shell, must be the only option specified -m\tload the start-up file, whether or not owned by effective user -n file\tno execute mode, just check syntax of the following `file' -q\taccept SIGQUIT for running under a debugger -s\tread commands from standard input -t\tread one line from standard input -v\techo commands after history substitution -V\tlike -v but including commands read from the start-up file -x\techo commands immediately before execution -X\tlike -x but including commands read from the start-up file --help\tprint this message and exit --version\tprint the version shell variable and exit See the tcsh(1) manual page for detailed information.  If you are looking for parameter instead of argument, go to this page parameter.\nSometimes, we will see a cshell script which starts with /usr/bin/env csh -fx, this means using csh to execute, and when launching csh, ignore the start-up file (cshrc) and always print out the command before execution.\nIf cshell is not the default shell, launch the cshell by typing csh (in case cshell is not installed, we can install csh quit easily in most of platforms - google install csh).\nIf we want to write a Cabell executable file, here is the example:\n#!/usr/bin/env tcsh echo \u0026quot;This is my first csh example\u0026quot; ; exit ;  Save the content into a file named demo_001.csh.\nRun the following commands:\nchmod +x demo_001.csh ./demo_001.csh  The first line of an executable file starting with #! is (on Linux) interpreted by the Linux kernel inside the implementation of execve system call (which is invoked, after fork, by the shell for most commands - those that are not functions and not shell builtins).\nAbout \u0026ldquo;Hash-Bang\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Shebang\u0026rdquo;, refer to this wiki page - SheBang (Unix).\nExercises  Get the help of csh on your own machine.

The services like raindrop.io, App List, cubox, etc. They all have their own use cases and scenarios. And Cubox can support tags, date, sort, and other more functions. Comparing to these apps, Notion is a good replacement which can serve the collection very well.\nResult This is the view for my current inbox (Table View). The links are added to the inbox by sharing function from my iPhone when I browse the technical articles or news. And they are also from my EDGE browser on MAC or PC. When I browse online for news or technical topic, or work related items, I will simply click share the link and put them to the Notion/Inbox.\nThe table in Notion is a type of database, so we can add any column we want. I added one checkbox column called \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; (Check Notion and Obsidian), tags and create date. At the bottom, for each column, we can also define the summary for each column.\nSwitch to Gallery View\nUnderstand Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to build the Inbox page in your Notion. In the Inbox or Collection, you can put anything you want, an article link, an apple store app link, a piece of idea, a text message, and so on. This is easy to be done by just click the share button on the smart phone. Since we are building a read later database, so we can put any property we want to each item. I have uninstalled several apps in my iPhone, what about you?\nCreate a new page Click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button next to the WORKSPACE or PRIVATE. And then give the new page a name, for instance, \u0026ldquo;Inbox\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Collection\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd \u0026ldquo;Table\u0026rdquo; database Create a table for the new page\nThen you will get an empty page like this.\nCustomize Columns Now, we can define the columns in our collection table. I want to add 2 more columns, one is \u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; and another one is \u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;To Obsidian\u0026rdquo; is a checkbox to tell which would be going to the Obsidian, transfer the knowing to knowledge.\n\u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo; is the date and time when each row is created. This will tell me when did I snap the article in.\nImprove Now we have the table, by install the iOS or Android Notion app, click any share button and save the content to the Notion\u0026gt;Collection. All the Notion with the same account will update the table, and then start to do the close reading, transfer the knowledge, etc.\nThe table column also has sort and filter function. Please play around the followings:\n Add a \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo; column. Once the article is read, mark it. Filter the column \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, only display \u0026ldquo;Unread\u0026rdquo; items. Sort by \u0026ldquo;Create Date\u0026rdquo; Try the summary of columns, show the count, date duration, etc. Add new property for the data item per the need and it will apply to all the items.
